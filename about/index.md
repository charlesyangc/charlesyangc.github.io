<!-- - West Lafayette,  -->

I love philosophy and mathematics. <!-- I always hate myself for not being able to find time to self-learn philosophy and mathematics. --> I am passionately curious about the truth of the world. It's all about abstraction, distinguishing and changing point of view. I believe human's future relies on computation. I believe in learning, thinking and moderate hard-working. <!-- I am obsessed with non-linearity. -->
